Well I guess just one thing I want to add to that was that when compiling a list like this. Yes. You have to cut out good things because we're trying to like simmer it down to like six you know of the best. Which means there's heaps of other really awesome ones that didn't make the cut. So in that regard it's like all right well we've chosen the pistol. Let's go in.",

What I like about it most is the mobility that it requires through the ankle and through the knee. Yeah it is actually a mobility test guy so if you if you've ever tried to do a pistol squat you're standing on one leg. If you've never heard of a pistol squat. I'll do my best articulate to you're standing on one leg with your other leg extended your hands.",

Now some people might be able to do one or two but to be able to do a good set with clean technique for anywhere between you know six to ten reps. Yeah there's no lies there.",
